# 100DaysOfMlCode
I will log my tries on a 100 days journey of machine learning here. Furthermore, I'll publish some of them through my twitter account.

#### Day 5: December 28th, 2018
I have got deeper in binary and multiclass classification through the week 3 of Andrew Ng course. The All-vs-one or All-vs-rest algorithm reminds me of the battles of Napolean. Also, I successfully passed the mid-week quiz and got the 100 percent of its mark.  #100DaysOfMlCode #Day5

#### Day 4: December 27th, 2018
I Started the week 3 and go through the Classification and its representation. Also, I had a review on week 1 and 2, because I've got confused about some of the ideas.  #100DaysOfMlCode #Day4

#### Day 3: December 25th, 2018
I've finished the week2 assignment successfully and started the new week which covers the classification and Logistic Regression. Furthermore, I tried some matrix examples and properties in Octave. It seems to be fun. #100DaysOfMlCode #Day3

#### Day 2: December 20th, 2018
On the second day, I've been reviewing week 1 and week 2 and tracing the theories in #Octave to prepare myself for solving the rest of the assignment of week 2. I myself really eager to know and understand the ideas deeply, so decided to have a review on the passed sections. #100DaysOfMlCode #Day2

#### Day 1: December 19th, 2018
Of course, this was not my first day of studying ML, but it is the first day of my 100 days journey of ML. Today, I've studied some videos about #Octave, a quiz and 2 first parts of the week 2 assignment in machine learning course of Andrew Ng on Coursera.org. #100DaysOfMlCode #Day1
