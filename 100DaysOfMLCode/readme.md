#### Day 1: December 18th, 2018
Of course, this was not my first day of studying ML, but it is the first day of my 100 days journey of ML. On this day, I've studied some videos about #Octave, a quiz and 2 first parts of the week 2 assignment in machine learning course of Andrew Ng on Coursera.org. #100DaysOfMlCode #Day1
