# 100DaysOfMlCode
Although, this is not my first n-days challenge of sth, and I left some previous behind, but due to the motives of my friend @Mehran97_r, I hope to stick on this. Alongside the twitter, I'm going to log the days on my GitHub account. #100DaysOfMlCode #Day1

#### Day 2: December 19th, 2018
On the second day, I've been reviewing week 1 and week 2 and tracing the theories in #Octave to prepare myself for solving the rest of the assignment of week 2. I myself really eager to know and understand the ideas deeply, so decided to have a review on the passed sections. #100DaysOfMlCode #Day2

#### Day 1: December 18th, 2018
Of course, this was not my first day of studying ML, but it is the first day of my 100 days journey of ML. On this day, I've studied some videos about #Octave, a quiz and 2 first parts of the week 2 assignment in machine learning course of Andrew Ng on Coursera.org. #100DaysOfMlCode #Day1
